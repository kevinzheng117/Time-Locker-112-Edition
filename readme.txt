# Time Locker: 112 Edition

Welcome to **Time Locker: 112 Edition**, a top-down shooter game with a unique time-warping mechanic. This project was built as part of the 112 coursework and features an endless map, dynamic enemies, and engaging gameplay mechanics designed to test both strategy and reflexes.

## 🎮 Project Summary
Time Locker is a 2D pixel-art game designed for computer play. The player's objective is to achieve the highest score by:
- Moving forward
- Defeating enemies

The map contains randomly generated enemies and obstacles. Enemies vary in health, movement patterns, and attack methods. Special enemies can track and shoot at the player. If an enemy or projectile touches the player, they lose.

## 🕹️ Controls & Mechanics
### Movement
- Arrow keys to move.

### Shooting
- The character shoots projectiles while moving.

### Time-Warping Mechanic
- Move slowly = Time slows down.
- Move quickly = Time fast-forwards.
- Stop moving = Time pauses, but a shadow advances from behind. If caught by the shadow, the player loses.
